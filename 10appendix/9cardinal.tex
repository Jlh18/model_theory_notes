\begin{lem}[Infinite union of finite]
    \link{infinite_union_of_finite}
    Let $I$ be an infinite set such that each $i \in I$ is finite and 
    non-empty.
    Then there exists an injection $\bigcup I to I$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Note that $\bigcup I$ injects into 
    $\bigsqcup I = \set{(i,x) \st x \in i \in I}$ by choice 
    (using the fact that each $i$ is non-empty).
    Each $i$ is finite thus bijects with a natural $n$ 
    by the well-ordering principle.
    Hence there exists an injective map $f_i : i \to \N$.
    Hence we have a map $\bigsqcup I \to I \times \N$ by taking 
    $(i,x) \mapsto (i,f_i(x))$ which is injective since each $f_i$ is injective.
    Hence 
    \[\abs{\bigcup I} \leq \abs{\bigsqcup I} \leq I \times \N \leq 
    I \times I = I\]
    The last two equalities are because $I$ is infinite.
    %?Infinite \times infinite is infinite
    %?\N injects into infinite
    %?product respects injection
  \end{proof}

\begin{lem}[Well ordering theorem]
  \link{well_ordering_thm}
  Any set can be well ordered.
\end{lem}
